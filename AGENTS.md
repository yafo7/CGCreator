# CGCreator Agent Guide

CGCreator extends WorldForge with an editable realtime cinematic compiler and workspace. The repository owner has authorized modifications to core source for this implementation. Retain the WorldForge editor and map protocol. CG-specific code lives in `src/shared/cg*`, `src/server/cg*`, and `src/client/cg*`.

Director intent, compiled tracks, and confirmed playback are separate artifacts. Always enforce user constraints in code. AI patches cannot remove or rewrite manual constraints. Playback must evaluate an absolute time without accumulated motion; actor world movement has one owner, and animation clips are in-place. Keep a confirmed version available during failed or incomplete revisions. Do not claim unsupported actions succeeded.

Project guidance is in `skills/cg-director/SKILL.md` and `skills/cg-camera-direction/SKILL.md`. These guide authoring; executable capability definitions and validation live in the TypeScript compiler. Run all tests, build, and visible browser verification before delivery.

## Scope

This repository is a standalone Three.js scene editor. Do not add game rooms, multiplayer state, WebSocket gameplay, or Electron unless the user explicitly changes the product scope.

## Architecture

- `src/client/`: editor UI and Three.js rendering
- `src/shared/`: map schema, math, bounds, and normalization
- `src/server/`: local HTTP API, file store, model backend adapter, and CLI
- `data/map-editor/`: runtime data; never commit it

Client, server, and CLI must use the same types and normalization rules. Prefer a small direct change over a speculative abstraction.

## Agent Editing

Use `/api/editor`, `npm run map`, or the project skill. Do not directly rewrite files under `data/`. Submit one generation/refine result as one `MapOperation[]` transaction. The server applies it atomically and persists one undo snapshot; undo creates the matching one-step redo snapshot, while a later direct/manual save clears both.

Map generation and render generation are separate stages. Do not put final rendering style into map data. Do not apply a render scheme before the user confirms the map.

Map AI should express repeated placement as bounded `scatters`; the server expands them into deterministic `object.add` operations before preview. Keep map-size quotas derived from bounds, and preserve stored terrain resolution when loading older maps.

Map AI should express the base height field as one `terrain.generate` operation and use brushes only for local refinement. PCG derives from the persisted map `seed`; keep terrain generation and terrain analysis in shared modules instead of adding coordinate algorithms to `mapAi.ts`.

Run deterministic map lint after the proposed operations are applied in memory. Safe repairs must be appended to the same transaction; aesthetic findings stay diagnostic-only. Keep asset-level tags separate from model node/material tags, and derive footprint metadata from the actual collider plan.

Render schemes own their `RenderPlan` and `accessPolicy`. Developer edits must preview live and save as a new scheme; do not overwrite built-in presets. AI and developer permissions/ranges are validated separately. Scoped material, water, and effect changes must stay under `modelsRoot`.

## Safety

- Y-up; `y=0` is sea level. Terrain heights may go negative down to `TERRAIN_MIN_HEIGHT`: adding or updating a lake carves its basin into the height field so the water plane sits inside the terrain.
- External agents must not modify core source by default.
- New Shader code must follow the permission ladder in `docs/architecture.md`.
- Do not push, publish, or contact external services unless the user explicitly asks.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
npm test
npm run build
```

For editor changes, also verify the local API and the visible browser flow.
